# ARIMA
time series analytics of web logs using ARIMA

I utilize the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, which combines autoregressive (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA) components to fit and forecast time series data. All experiments were done using open dataset (https://ita.ee.lbl.gov/html/contrib/EPA-HTTP.html).
